# Watch Search Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The system was returning perfumes instead of watches because:
1. All products in the catalog have `"category": null`
2. The category-based filtering was relying on the null category field
3. No fallback to detect categories from product titles/descriptions

## Fix Applied
Updated `server/services/vector-storage.ts` to detect categories from product titles and descriptions:

### Before:
```typescript
if (queryLower.includes('watch') && item.category?.toLowerCase().includes('watch')) {
  score *= 2.0;
}
```

### After:
```typescript
const itemTitle = item.title?.toLowerCase() || '';
const itemDescription = item.description?.toLowerCase() || '';

// Detect watch products
if (queryLower.includes('watch') && (itemTitle.includes('watch') || itemDescription.includes('watch'))) {
  score *= 2.0; // Strong boost for watch category
}
// Detect perfume products
else if (queryLower.includes('perfume') && (itemTitle.includes('perfume') || itemTitle.includes('edp') || itemTitle.includes('edt') || itemDescription.includes('perfume'))) {
  score *= 2.0; // Strong boost for perfume category
}
```

## How to Test
1. Start the server: `npm run dev`
2. Send a message: "show me women watches"
3. Expected result: Should return actual watch products, not perfumes

## Verification
The fix should now:
- ✅ Detect watch products by searching for "watch" in title/description
- ✅ Detect perfume products by searching for "perfume", "edp", "edt" in title/description
- ✅ Apply 2x score boost for matching categories
- ✅ Maintain gender-specific filtering (women/men)

## Expected Behavior
When you ask "show me women watches", the system should:
1. Detect "watch" in the query
2. Find products with "watch" in title/description
3. Apply 2x score boost to those products
4. Filter for women-specific products
5. Return actual watch products instead of perfumes
