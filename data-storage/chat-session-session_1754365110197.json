    "content": "Hello! I'm glad to help you find some women's watches under 2000 AED. Based on our current product catalog, here's a recommendation:\n\n1. **Juvenis Women Analog Watch - JV1637W**: This stylish watch features a Japanese quartz movement, which means no manual winding is required. It's made of stainless steel and is water-resistant up to 3 ATM. It's a great everyday watch and is priced at just 296 AED. You can find more details [here](https://www.karjistore.com/juvenis-women-analog-watch-jv1637w).\n\nUnfortunately, this is the only women's watch we have under 2000 AED at the moment. If you're looking for something specific in terms of style, material, or features, please let me know, and I'd be happy to make some more suggestions.\n\nWould you like some recommendations on other accessories or products, or do you have any other questions I can assist with? I'm here to help!",
